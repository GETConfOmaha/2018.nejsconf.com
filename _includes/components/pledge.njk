      <p>GETconf 2019 was a success, but our work is not done.  We want to exchange ideas, build community, and take action to advance gender equity in the tech workforce in Omaha.</p>
      <p>For 2020, we invite all members of our community to pledge to champion gender equity in their own communities and workplaces.</p>
      <p>We will be collecting stories from the community, anonymizing them, and sharing them. We would love to have yours.</p>
